# Resolute
Resolute is a 2D strategic game where you defend against an enemy.

How to Play:
- Click the green box on the right side of the screen, then select a grid square. This will allow  you to place guns on the game field
- Add as many guns as you would like, and they will automatically target enemies.

The game currently doesn't do much, but more will be added in the near future.
